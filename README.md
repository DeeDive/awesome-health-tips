Welcome to the Awesome Health Tips repository! This repository serves as a community-driven hub for sharing practical tips that can be incrementally checked and followed during everyone's rest time. Let us make easy-to-follow, actionable steps!
 
YOU are the most valuable asset. A PhD takes five or more years' grinding, and the life takes even longer. There is [a myriad of advice](https://github.com/pliang279/awesome-phd-advice) on how to survive in your professional area, but not that much on how to prioritize your health. Many senior graduates end up with regrets since not all injuries can be fully healed, and some may result in permanent damage. This repository aims to fill that gap by providing practical tips and advice for staying healthy and fit. Let us take preventive steps to keep fit.

****Disclaimer:*** However, please note that by no means do these health-keeping and illness-avoidance advice replace medical diagnosis and judgments. For any medical concerns or questions, please consult with a qualified healthcare professional.*

## Physical Health
### Exercise Regularly
**Rule of thumb:** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.

**Short reason:** Regular exercise can help improve cardiovascular health, maintain a healthy body weight, increase energy levels, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.

**Actionable steps:**
- Choose activities you enjoy, such as walking, cycling, swimming, or dancing.
- Break your exercise routine into smaller sessions, like 30 minutes per day, five days a week.
- Include both aerobic and anaerobic exercises in your routine.
- Gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time.

### Eye Health and Reading Habits

**Rule of thumb:** Adopt healthy reading habits and take care of your eyes to prevent eye strain and vision problems.

**Short reason:** Prolonged reading, especially on digital screens, can cause eye strain, dryness, and discomfort, which can negatively impact productivity and overall eye health.

**Actionable steps:**
- Follow the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away.
- Adjust the brightness, contrast, and font size of digital screens to reduce eye strain.
- Position your screen at a comfortable distance and angle, typically at arm's length and slightly below eye level.
- Use proper lighting to minimize glare and shadows while reading.
- Blink frequently to keep your eyes moist and reduce dryness.
- Consider using blue light-filtering glasses or screen protectors to reduce blue light exposure from digital devices.
- Regularly have your eyes checked by an optometrist or ophthalmologist to monitor and address vision changes.

## Mental Health

### Imposter Syndrome

**Rule of thumb:** Recognize the signs of imposter syndrome and develop strategies to manage it.

**Reason:** Imposter syndrome is a common psychological phenomenon where individuals feel like they are not as competent as others perceive them to be. This feeling is prevalent among PhD students, who often experience high levels of stress and pressure in their academic careers.

Examples of Imposter Syndrome in PhD Students include:

- You're asked to develop a new algorithm or method for your research project, and you feel the pressure to create something flawless that would impress your peers and advisors.
- You struggle to understand complex theories or concepts in your field, and you feel overwhelmed by your inability to grasp them.
- You secretly refer to online forums or discussion boards for simple questions and worry about appearing incompetent if your mentor, advisor, or fellow students notice.
- You feel inadequate after attending academic conferences or workshops where numerous new ideas are presented but don't have the time or bandwidth to explore them all.

Addressing imposter syndrome is essential for maintaining mental well-being and achieving your full potential.

**Actionable steps:**
- Remind yourself that it's okay to feel this way and that even senior researchers experience similar feelings. Recognizing this can help you accept your own emotions and overcome imposter syndrome.
- Acknowledge your accomplishments and remind yourself of your successes.
- Develop a growth mindset, focusing on learning and improvement rather than perfection.
- Seek help when needed, such as talking to trusted peers, mentors, or advisors.
- Share your experiences with others and create a supportive environment for both yourself and your colleagues.
